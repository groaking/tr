- **Rush Garcia** — Sketch 12 - Kingdom

_The songs got us in time of the emergence of the non-Mirror-COA BSO Voyage III, a BSO on the fourth Homeleft. The "Makmur Mandiri" bus fare, the C-Travelo planning in advance, the 4.0 GPA, the "rainbow satisfying bubble warp immitation" and the "magnetic sketcher" owned by Five and/or Cent.  It bears the identity "Reminsicence" because the tracing mostly took place in Pixel, and the BSO Voyage III occured almost a year and a half after the last time we (collectively) left Wonderland for Sunne on October 7th, 2021—long before the Unanimous-Unbris was even a thing, and we were still emotionally engaged with Alley. Thus, the TR is a reminiscence of the post-A-N period and the post-Homeleft Consilience event. [2022-12-29]_

_The Tracerecord that was traced during the pre-Homeleft period of the Ramadhan vacation of BF-Meh-2. Almost every day did we sleep on the desk (marked by the logging of Logbook No. 585). It was named such, "Change," because there were many STATE CHANGES occuring during the tracing period of this z-TR. To name a few: - The overworking of QRI-Meh-1 for 12 hours and a half - The "Sosialisasi LK" event of NV-Meh-14 at Geen from 4 p.m. until 9.30 p.m. on a Friday - Video-call (for the first time) through Meta-FB with Xexo at Symbian after the Jcis for two hours  During the tracing period of this z-TR, we also attempted to Bodon (to donate blood) when the Bodon event was held at Adver due to Easter weeks. Nevertheless, we did not make it through the screening test because our hemoglobin level was 0.1 less than required at the time. [2023-04-19]_

_This z-Tracerecord got its name since it was traced and TR-B-to-TR-A converted during a period in the Art Order of Projectile-ZZZ called the Artistic Relapse Period (`zzz.0:300$y`), which is deemed as one of the lowest phase recorded during the writing of Projectile-ZZZ. Some events recorded during the tracing of Low Block's TR-B are: - Over-excessive Binet (Swimming Pool Vento `zzz.0:397~113`) - The second Feruar to Jci during a Wedcis (Second Feruar Vento `zzz.0:420~120`) - TO and Fideweb, violation against Ursia Decision (Cognitive Dissonance Vento `zzz.0:424~122`) - Breaking-up with Haha/Meta-FB for 120 hours (Quiet Week Vento `zzz.0:429~124`)  The TR-B was called "Enduring Control". And the `nd-1004` form narrates the TR-B as follows:  "[The TR-B] began being traced during the Artistic Relapse Period (`zzz.0:300$y`) where Wonit lost control over several things in his life —and he must endure the last weeks of Neptunal VIII" [2023-08-04]_

_The Tracerecord was traced during the restless period of Artistic Pitfall Loop (zzz.0:535), which was signified by the ever-increasing and climaxing intensity of zre-Ach-Fedor, Binet, Fideweb, TO-Fedor, and Fika. Eventually, this Tracerecord saw the eventual tragedy cascading from the Artistic Relapse Period (zzz.0:300) commonly known as the Wrecked Post-Artistic Loop (w.0:3) where Bear unattended any Neptunal X Sunsen Sudco Ulects for the entire 2 weeks since October 16th, 2023.

_This TR-A was traced during the second month of the ever-unveiling Qinxing (w.0:31$y) relapse of the Wrecked Post-Artistic Loop (w.0:3$y). During the tracing, gradually the stocks of milk powder, condiments, and other foods delivered from Map, Cent, and Dress, which were thought of to cause the urge to Binet, were depleted. Eventually, Powpow was no longer observed.  "It was traced during the beginning of the third week of the shameful (Culob-wise) occurrence of Wrecked Post-Artistic Loop (`w.0:3`) ... the "shameful destruction" of the Wrecked Post-Artistic Loop (w.0:3$y) created a sense of guilt within Wonit's self" [/ssynthesia/spygrade/seahorse/nd/nd-1004/13-shameful-destruction]_

_This Tracerecord was established and traced during the ever-unveiling outrage of the period of Qinxing (`w.0:31$y`), which was an Exigen-like avoidance behavior of Wonit during the Neptunal X period of Binary/Sunsen. It was started being traced at the end of Sunsen's Neptunal X term, when consequences of Qinxing (`w.0:31$y`) started being felt by Wonit (II-φ).

_This tracerecord was created immediately after wonit realized that Gamaband has released a second album named "Lakara". [nd-1004/19-nouveau-gama] It was traced during trip to attend the NV-Meh-47 poetry-writing competition in Owci with Kata (`HWA 022-12 NC~51`; hence the identity). We lost. We got upset because the judge thought that archaic words aren't fitting for their contemporary taste. This TR was also traced during the early development phase of BV-Meh-34 app-making project in Wonderland, where Wonit had several Esudes with Devoso almost each night. [2024-08-08]_

# F. Suspenzion Record
_This record was established during the period of Likikisit (`w.0:498~159`) in which period wonit had suspended from a significant number of Binary/Sunsen ulects. It was marked by the moving of B.A.S.E from Symbian to Kotilinit, which was believed to alleviate the malidarisit tendency of Four. The marking character "z" in "Suspenzion" was derived from "Halzion", which is one of the songs in the first TR-A of this record, Yue Block. This TR record also marked the beginning of bear's positive polarization toward Yue (`HWA 022-12 NC~120`)_

_This TR-A marked wonit's increased positive polarization toward Yue as a Tisut. The story recounted in the poem **Yue Ponea** (`lp.0:310~120`) showed that once wonit had a scintillating conversation with Yue on a Saturday evening, and found out that Yue also had interests in Mili, Yorushika, and Toto. From Tuesday, July 30, 2024 to August 7, 2024, Bear and Yue continuously exchanged messages by means of Susunen. Therein Yue gave wonit several song recommendations by the artist "DAG", which wonit immediately listened to and made tracerecord. [2024-08-08]_
